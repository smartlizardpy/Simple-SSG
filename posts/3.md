# From Trash to Dashboard: I Made a Server Out of Old Tech

I found an old dusty mini-PC in a drawer. Naturally, I turned it into a local data dashboard.

## 🧰 The Build

- 🖥️ HP ProDesk + Ubuntu Server
- 🧠 Mosquitto MQTT broker
- 📈 Node-RED for data flows
- 📊 Grafana for dashboard magic

## 🔌 What It Does

- Reads DHT11 temp/humidity from my room (via Pico)
- Graphs it in real time
- Notifies me if my room turns into a sauna

Also shows CPU stats and lets me control a lamp via MQTT. Science.

## 🧼 Why Not Buy One?

Because:

1. I'm broke.
2. This is more fun.
3. E-waste is a crime.

## 🧪 Bonus Use

I added a “family scoreboard” — whoever makes the most tea gets a point.

Not just a server — it’s my **domestic command center.**
