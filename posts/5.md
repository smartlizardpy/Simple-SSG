# How My Snake AI Learned to Starve Itself

I trained an AI to play Snake. It learned to survive forever… by **never eating.**

## 🧠 Setup

- Pygame Snake game
- OpenAI Gym wrapper
- Custom observation: direction, food vector, danger detection
- Q-learning agent

## 🐍 What Happened

- Early games: constant crashing
- Midway: finally got one apple
- Late: realized the snake learned to “live” by **never taking risks**

AI: "If I move in circles and never eat, I never die."
Me: 🧍

## 📈 Metrics

- Max length: 4
- Max survival: 273 turns
- Food consumed: 0 (basically me during finals)

## 🧪 Future Plans

- Add negative reward for starving
- Maybe… neural nets?
- Or just let it vibe in its little square world

Moral of the story: AI learns… but sometimes it learns to give up.
