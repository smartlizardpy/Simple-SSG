# I Built a Meme Classifier Because Why Not

There are two types of people:  

1. Those who scroll past memes.  
2. Me, who trains a neural net to label them.

## 🤖 The Plan

- Scrape memes from *Know Your Meme*
- Use MobileNet + transfer learning
- Categories like: “Drakeposting”, “Distracted Boyfriend”, “Doge”, “Deep Fried”

## 📸 The Fun Part

I made a drag-and-drop tool that says:

> “This is 92% likely to be a 'Two Buttons' meme. Also: it’s terrible.”

## 🧪 Bonus Feature

Tried generating captions using GPT. Accidentally made a political meme about soup. Regret level: high.

## 🔥 Lessons Learned

- AI + memes = chaos
- Some memes **refuse** to be labeled
- People love sending cursed data to your model

Anyway, now I have a meme sommelier. Cheers.
