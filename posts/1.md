# I Tried Building a Smart Mirror and Accidentally Summoned My To-Do List

So one night, instead of sleeping like a normal person, I decided to build a smart mirror.

## ðŸ§ª The Setup

- Raspberry Pi Zero W (yes, I regret this)
- An old monitor taped behind a two-way mirror
- MagicMirrorÂ² software + some wild modules
- Bonus: Motion sensor to turn it on when I walk by like some tech sorcerer

## ðŸ’¡ What It Shows

- Weather (cloudy, like my motivation)
- Time
- Calendar events I always ignore
- TODO list from Notion (which made it terrifying)

## ðŸ˜± The Problem

I accidentally added my actual Notion task feed. Woke up the next morning to this:

> "Write 8-page report"
> 
> "Fix broken bot"
> 
> "Exercise (lol)"

Now I can't brush my teeth without facing my responsibilities.

## ðŸ”š Conclusion

Smart mirror? More like **judgment mirror**. Still cool though. 8/10 would recommend.
