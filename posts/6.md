# Home Internet? Nah, I Built a Pirate Radio Station (Just for Science)

Because why stream music legally when you can broadcast it locally like itâ€™s 1985?

## ðŸ“» The Rig

- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Icecast2 server
- Liquidsoap to manage stream logic
- LAN-only setup (Iâ€™m not going to jail, thanks)

## ðŸŽ§ What It Plays

- Handpicked MP3s
- TTS DJ intros between tracks
- Occasionally yells "You're listening to Radio Chaos!"

## ðŸš“ The Legal Stuff

**Donâ€™t broadcast over FM.**  
But streaming inside your home LAN = totally fine (like yelling at your own walls).

## ðŸ§ª Features

- Web client + cover art
- `/api/next` to skip tracks via browser
- `/nowplaying` JSON endpoint for nerd cred

Is it useful? Not really.  
Is it fun? **Absolutely.**

Coming soon: Local radio game nights.
