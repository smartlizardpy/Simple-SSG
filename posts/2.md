# How I Made My Music Player Say "Next Song, Loser"

You know what's missing from most music players? **Trash talk.**

## 🎵 The Stack

- HTML/JS front end with Web Audio API
- Local Python Flask server with endpoints like `/api/next`
- TTS via gTTS or ElevenLabs
- Animated bars that bounce with the beat
- Background images and playlist queue

## 💬 The Feature

After each song, a TTS voice says something like:

> “That was mid. Let’s try again.”

or

> “Skipping… because you clearly have no taste.”

## 😎 Why Tho?

Because it’s funny.  
Because music is too serious.  
Because you can.

## ✅ What’s Next?

- Let users upload insult packs
- Auto-meme overlay on music
- Discord integration?

Tired of boring players? Build one that **judges you in stereo.**
