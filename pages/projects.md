## ðŸš§ VEX IQ Robotics
In our first year in the Vex IQ ecosystem we went to the competitions in TÃ¼rkiye. We where new to its kits. First we built the sample robot for the competitons. And start to develop the robot to a 2 shooter robot. It was the most advanced in its leauge. So we went to 3 competitons and got an invitation to the country finals in the last competition. You can learn more about our robot & our team at our team website.

## Vex IQ Team Website

Yeah! I built my team website. I decided to go on a basic and modern MD look for it. It was basic. We used a tech stack of Astro & Cloudflare Pages. It was basic. It had a link to our youtube channel which you should go check out! I roughly built the first version in 2 Hours and it sucked so i cleaned it up and polished it which ended up taking 4-5 hours of work. That i spread in to 2 days. You can check out the source code of the website. I need to warn you because its like spagetti!

## Concert Website 1.0

This is the first version of the concert website. My neighbour is a piano & violin teacher and she organises concerts where her students play. I decided to create a website that shows live who is playing and which song is that. So i embarked on a journey to make that idea happen. My tech stack involves of Html ,css ,js & the backend is Supabase. It uses the realtime api. There is a JSON that has the concert data we select the performer and send it to the DB and change the data to the realtime api.
For the privacy of the students I cannot share the  the link of the website.

## Concert Website 2.0
This is the second one of the concert website. My neighbour is a piano & violin teacher and she organises concerts where her students play. I decided to create a website that displays the name of the performers and the songs they are playing. It has a embedded live stream of the concert.The tech stack uses Vue, Tailwind & Cloudflare Pages . I also needed to genererate a graphics system for the live stream. I created it from scratch.
### Graphics System 1.0
This uses a html lower third and conncets to the flask and  websocket backend. it send performer data to the html and as a browser source to OBS.

### Graphics System 2.0
I used Nodecg and incorperated the json of the concert.
It was nice and 80 people watched the stream

## Cousins Bio Website

My first website. It was for my cousin who is a football player. I didn't knew anything about HTML&CSS so I opened notepad++ and started to write code and look from w3 schools. I didnt change it for to see my mistakes. I tried to change styles of individual  images by "<img1" "<img2" etc.
It was a bio for him. I wanted to add it to my projects part because i wanted to add when I first started how I wrote html.
