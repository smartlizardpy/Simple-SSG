## 👋 Hi, I'm Ozan




I’m 13, but don’t let the age fool you — I already build real projects using Vue.js, JavaScript, and Python.

Coding isn't just a hobby — it's how I bring ideas to life. I love creating websites, apps, and fun side projects that challenge me to learn more every day.

Outside of tech, I'm into photography, gaming, and exploring new creative stuff.

## 📸 Photography

My photography journey started with my dad’s Nikon D3300.

At first, I was just curious. I started learning little by little — how lighting changes everything, how angles can tell a different story, and how editing brings a photo to life.

Whether it’s nature, random street shots, or just cool vibes with friends — I love capturing moments that feel real.
## 🥁 Drumming

I've been drumming since I was 6 years old. Playing drums lets me express creativity in a whole new way, and I enjoy experimenting with different rhythms and styles — especially metal, which I love for its energy and complexity.
