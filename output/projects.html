        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <article>
            <p>A few of my favorite design &amp; coding projects so far:</p>
<hr />
<h2>üöß VEX IQ Robotics</h2>
<p>In our first year in the Vex IQ ecosystem we went to the competitions in T√ºrkiye. We where new to its kits. First we built the sample robot for the competitons. And start to develop the robot to a 2 shooter robot. It was the most advanced in its leauge. So we went to 3 competitons and got an invitation to the country finals in the last competition. You can learn more about our robot &amp; our team at our team website.</p>

<h2>Vex IQ Team Website</h2>
<p>Yeah! I built my team website. I decided to go on a basic and modern MD look for it. It was basic. We used a tech stack of Astro &amp; Cloudflare Pages. It was basic. It had a link to our youtube channel which you should go check out! I roughly built the first version in 2 Hours and it sucked so i cleaned it up and polished it which ended up taking 4-5 hours of work. That i spread in to 2 days. You can check out the source code of the website. I need to warn you because its like spagetti!

<h2>Concert Website 1.0</h2>
<p>This is the first version of the concert website. My neighbour is a piano &amp; violin teacher and she organises concerts where her students play. I decided to create a website that shows live who is playing and which song is that. So i embarked on a journey to make that idea happen. My tech stack involves of Html ,css ,js &amp; the backend is Supabase. It uses the realtime api. There is a JSON that has the concert data we select the performer and send it to the DB and change the data to the realtime api.
For the privacy of the students I cannot share the  the link of the website.

<h2>Concert Website 2.0</h2>
<p>This is the second one of the concert website. My neighbour is a piano &amp; violin teacher and she organises concerts where her students play. I decided to create a website that displays the name of the performers and the songs they are playing. It has a embedded live stream of the concert.The tech stack uses Vue, Tailwind &amp; Cloudflare Pages . I also needed to genererate a graphics system for the live stream. I created it from scratch.</p>
<h3>Graphics System 1.0</h3>
<p>This uses a html lower third and conncets to the flask and  websocket backend. it send performer data to the html and as a browser source to OBS.</p>
<h3>Graphics System 2.0</h3>
<p>I used Nodecg and incorperated the json of the concert.
It was nice and 80 people watched the stream</p>

<h2>Cousins Bio Website</h2>
<p>My first website. It was for my cousin who is a football player. I didn't knew anything about HTML&amp;CSS so I opened notepad++ and started to write code and look from w3 schools. I didnt change it for to see my mistakes. I tried to change styles of individual  images by "&lt;img1" "&lt;img2" etc.
It was a bio for him. I wanted to add it to my projects part because i wanted to add when I first started how I wrote html.</p>
